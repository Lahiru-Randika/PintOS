# PintOS

In this project, I implemented a simple interactive shell capable of executing commands and programs. # Note that we were only allowed to modify certain parts of the project, and some of the commands used were pre-built. The shell supports the following commands:

>whoami: Displays my name and my index number.

>shutdown: Shuts down the Pintos OS and exits the QEMU emulator.

>time: Shows the number of seconds that have passed since the Unix epoch.

>ram: Displays the amount of RAM available for the OS.

>thread: Provides statistics about the current thread.

>priority: Shows the thread priority of the current thread.

This was challenging, yet fun!
